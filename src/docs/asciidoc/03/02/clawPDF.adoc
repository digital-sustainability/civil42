ClawPDF may seem like yet another Virtual PDF/OCR/Image Printer, but it actually comes packed with features that are typically found in enterprise solutions. With clawPDF, you can create documents in various formats, including PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-3b, PDF/X, PDF/Image, OCR, SVG, PNG, JPEG, TIF, and TXT. You also have easy access to metadata and can remove it before sharing a document. In addition, you can protect your documents with a password and encrypt them with up to 256-bit AES.
